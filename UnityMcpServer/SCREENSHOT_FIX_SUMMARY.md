# Screenshot Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue
The Unity MCP Server's `take_screenshot` tool was failing with a serialization error:
```
Unable to serialize unknown type: <class 'mcp.server.fastmcp.utilities.types.Image'>
```

## Root Cause
The Python MCP server was trying to return an `Image` object, which the MCP framework couldn't serialize properly for transmission.

## Solution
Modified the `take_screenshot` function in `src/tools/take_screenshot.py` to return a dictionary with base64-encoded image data instead of an `Image` object.

### Key Changes:
1. **Return Format**: Changed from returning an `Image` object to returning a dictionary containing:
   - `success`: Boolean indicating if the screenshot was successful
   - `image_data`: Base64-encoded image data as a string
   - `metadata`: Dictionary with image information (view, dimensions, format, etc.)

2. **Serialization Fix**: The base64 string format is easily serializable by the MCP framework, eliminating the serialization error.

## Testing Results
âœ… **Unity Connection Test**: Successfully connects to Unity and receives screenshot data
âœ… **Image Data Validation**: Base64 data decodes correctly to valid PNG images
âœ… **Metadata Verification**: All metadata (view, dimensions, play mode) is correctly captured
âœ… **PIL Compatibility**: Decoded images can be opened and processed with PIL

## Test Scripts Created
1. `test_screenshot.py` - Tests direct Unity connection and screenshot capture
2. `test_mcp_screenshot.py` - Tests the MCP server screenshot functionality

## Current Status
ðŸŽ‰ **FIXED**: The screenshot functionality is now working correctly. The MCP server can successfully:
- Connect to Unity Editor
- Capture screenshots from Scene or Game view
- Return properly serialized image data
- Include comprehensive metadata about the screenshot

## Usage
The `take_screenshot` tool can now be used through the MCP server without serialization errors. It returns a dictionary that can be easily processed by MCP clients.
